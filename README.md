# FoodTracker
A sample XCode program/tutorial given by the [dev.apple site](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html)

#### NOTE: Make sure when adding the ImageView that you check the "Allow User Interaction" checkbox. I somehow glossed over this and spent an hour researching why the Tap Gesture Recognizer wasn't work and that wasn't it at ALL.

The default project has you create a local Git repository.  Using the GitHub documentation [HERE](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line) will add that local repository to a remote on GitHub.
